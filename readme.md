1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

- There are some differences between interfaces and types. like:
  1. **declaration style:** Interface declared only for object, on the other hand, apart from object, type can be declared for union, intersection, tuple, primitive, etc.
  2. **Extending:** Interface can easily be extended from multiple interfaces. We can extend with type, but using & (intersection).
  3. **Declaration merging:** After declaring interface many times, they can merge together. But in case of type it will show error.
  - For using object or making structure of class, interface is very useful. But at the time of using complex type union, tuple, conditional, etc. We should use type.
