1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
  There are some differences between interfaces and types. like: 1/ declaration style. Interface declared only for object, on the other hand, apart from object, type can be declared for union, intersection, tuple, primitive, etc. 2/ Extending. Interface can easily be extended from multiple interfaces. We can extend with type, but using & (intersection). 3/ Declaration merging. After declaring interface many times, they can merge together. But in case of type it will show error. For using object or making structure of class, interface is very useful. But at the time of using complex type union, tuple, conditional, etc. We should use type.
